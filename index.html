            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, 
            <blockquote class="village">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” </blockquote>
            The farmer said, 
            <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            <blockquote class="village">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote>
            The farmer again said, 
            <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
            <blockquote class="village">“Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,”</blockquote>
            and the farmer responded, 
            <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote> 
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
            <blockquote class="village">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote>
            Again, he said, 
            <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.
